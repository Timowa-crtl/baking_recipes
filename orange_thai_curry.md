# Orange Thai Curry  

## Ingredients  
- 150 g tofu, cubed  
- 1 onion, chopped  
- 2 carrots, cut into strips  
- 1 tbsp ginger, grated  
- 2 parsnips, cut into strips  
- 100 g green beans, chopped  
- 1 leek, sliced  
- 2 tbsp yellow curry paste (Cock Brand, "Gelbe Curry Paste")
- 1 can tomatoes (400 g)  
- 1 can coconut milk (400 ml)  
- 1 tbsp oil  
- 100 ml water  

## Preparation  
1. Chop the onion, grate the ginger, and prepare the vegetables.  
2. Fry the tofu in a pan with some oil until golden brown, remove from pan.
4. Sauté the onion and ginger until fragrant.  
5. Add remaining vegetables and stir-fry for a few minutes.  
6. Add curry paste and fry briefly until aromatic.  
7. Deglaze with the chopped tomatoes and mix well.  
8. Add 100 ml water and 2 tbsp of coconut milk, then bring to a simmer.  
9. Add the fried tofu and let everything simmer until the vegetables are tender but still crisp.  
10. Just before serving, add the remaining coconut milk and mix well.  
11. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Serve hot with basmati rice.  

> **Tip:** Adding the full coconut milk too early weakens its flavor—always reserve most of it until the end.  
> **Tip:** Stir-frying the vegetables first enhances their taste and keeps them crisp.  
> **Tip:** Best enjoyed with basmati rice.
